project : Predicting University scores using Machine Learning
overview:
The University Score Prediction Web Application utilizes machine learning to forecast
university scores based on parameters like education quality, alumni employment, faculty 
credentials, and research impact. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering ensure 
model accuracy, validated through testing before deployment on hosting platforms. Continuous 
monitoring and maintenance guarantee ongoing relevance, offering a transparent and 
accountable tool for informed decision-making in higher education selection. Ultimately, the 
project seeks to empower users by simplifying the complex process of university selection, 
providing a quick, accurate, and accessible solution for making well-informed educational 
choices
